# Clustering of ITS graphs

This repository contains code used to cluster ITS graphs of chemical reactions by isomorphism. Various graph invariants were tested which can be used to pre-filter the list of graphs, cutting down on computing time.

This repository is the results of a practical / computer lab for the module "Graphen und biologische Netzwerke" at the University of Leipzig.

# ToDo

- Add option to export final clusters
- Update environment.yml / dependencies
